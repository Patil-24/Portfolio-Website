          About Me
        </h1>
        <p data-aos='fade-left '>
        Greetings, I'm Iranna Patil, a dedicated React Native Developer with a fervor for crafting exceptional mobile experiences. Graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from N B Navale Sinhgad College of Engineering, Solapur, I embarked on a journey marked by innovation and excellence. My passion for technology ignited during my tenure at Codeworld Infotech, where I delved into the realms of React Native, Expo, and Redux-Toolkit, setting the stage for my professional career.
          <br />
          My current role at Bee Logical Software Solutions, Pune, sees me at the forefront of mobile application development, where I meticulously blend creativity and technical prowess to deliver seamless solutions across Android and iOS platforms. Leveraging my expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and a myriad of frameworks including React Native, I thrive in optimizing performance and functionality, ensuring timely project delivery while maintaining the highest standards of quality.  <br />
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new locations for an outing, hiking, or trying out new recipes in my kitchen. I'm a firm believer in work-life balance and strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
          <br/>
          Beyond the realm of coding, I am driven by a quest for continuous learning and growth, constantly seeking new challenges to broaden my skill set. My crowning achievement thus far has been leading my team, "Next_Innovation," to victory in Indiaâ€™s biggest technical competition, the Smart India Hackathon 2022, where our innovative solution garnered national recognition.
          <br/>
          Outside of work, you'll find me exploring the great outdoors, indulging in my love for adventure sports, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I firmly believe in the importance of work-life balance and strive to maintain a harmonious blend of professional excellence and personal fulfillment in all aspects of my life. Let's collaborate and create something extraordinary together!
